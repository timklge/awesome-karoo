## Introduction

Recently, hammerhead has published a new SDK that enables the development of extensions for Karoo cycling computers. This repository aims to compile a comprehensive list of extensions.

## Installation of extensions on your device

If you are using a Karoo 3, you can use [Hammerhead's sideloading procedure](https://support.hammerhead.io/hc/en-us/articles/31576497036827-Companion-App-Sideloading) to install extensions.

1. Open the releases page of your chosen extension on your phone's browser, long-press the link to the APK (usually `app-release.apk`) and share it with the Hammerhead Companion app.
2. Your karoo should show an info screen about the app now. Press "Install".
3. Open the app from the main menu.

If you are using a Karoo 2, you can use manual sideloading:

1. Download the apk from the releases page of your chosen extension
2. Set up your Karoo for sideloading. DC Rainmaker has a great [step-by-step guide](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/02/how-to-sideload-android-apps-on-your-hammerhead-karoo-1-karoo-2.html).
3. Install the app by running `adb install FILENAME.apk`.
4. Open the app from the main menu.

To update extensions after you have installed them, long-tap the app icon on the main menu and select "Update" (works on both Karoo 2 and Karoo 3).
